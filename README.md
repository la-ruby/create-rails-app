`create-rails-app` creates a rails application based on the "latest stable version" thats out there.
The end result is posted to https://github.com/la-ruby/common-core, so if your rails
application is based on the "common core", you can stay up to date by:

- Merging or rebasing off the common core (weekly)
- Run test suite
- Deploy to a canary server
- Deploy to all production nodes (assuming no issues in the canaries)
